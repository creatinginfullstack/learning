Problem:
Return the city in Europe with the lowest temperature:

Country:			Temperature (in deg Celcius)
Austria					1
Belgium					2
Cyprus					3
Denmark					4
Finland					5
Germany					6
Ireland					7
Norway					8
Poland					9
United Kingdom			10
Italy	 				1




============================================================================================
Solution:

Important! You should have noted that there are countries that have the same temperature.
You had to clarify the requirement - on what to do in case there are two countries with
the same lowest temperature.

This current implementation returns the first country with the lowest temperature, if there 
were two countries of the same lowest temperature value.
